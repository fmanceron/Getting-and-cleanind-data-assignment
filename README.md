The project assignment for this "Getting an Cleaning Data" course is composed of the following files:
 - This README.md markdown file located on the following GitHub repo:
		https://github.com/fmanceron/Getting-and-cleaning-data-assignment
 - A CodeBook.md file located in the same GitHub repository explaining the data manipulations
 - A features_info.txt file located in the same GitHub repository explaining the measures made, 
	as a complementary explanation to the CodeBook 
 - An 'R' code file called run_analysis.r containing the code and instruction list. 
	Directories structures to be able to run the code will be explained there.
 - A tidy data file called tidy_data.txt, produced by the run_analysis.r program, and located 
	in the working directory, as described in the instruction list

The code file is ready to be executed, provided the code and data files are in the appropriate
